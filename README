MVS::VBFile - Perl extension to read variable blocked files from MVS

MVS::VBFile is a Perl module.  It provides functions to get records
from mainframe MVS files in variable blocked (VB) format and to write
records in a similar format.  See the POD documentation in the module,
or "man MVS::VBFile" after you have installed it.

Prerequisites
=============
Only the standard Perl distribution.

How to Build and Install
========================
The usual:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

This module is written in Perl only, so it should be portable to
all UN*X platforms at least.
