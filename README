MVS::VBFile - Perl extension to read variable blocked files from MVS

MVS::VBFile is a Perl module.  It supplies a single function, vbget(),
that gets the next record (or all records) from a mainframe MVS file
in variable blocked (VB) format.

This module is written in Perl only, so it should be portable to
all UN*X platforms at least.
