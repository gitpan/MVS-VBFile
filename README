MVS::VBFile - Perl extension to read variable blocked files from MVS

MVS::VBFile is a Perl module.  It supplies a single function, vbget(),
that gets the next record from a mainframe MVS file in variable (VB
or V) format.  See the POD documentation in the module, or "man
MVS::VBFile" after you have installed it.

Prerequisites
=============
Only the standard Perl distribution.

How to Build and Install
========================
The usual:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

This module is written in Perl only, so it should be portable to
all UN*X platforms at least.
